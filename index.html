            <h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>
            <p>“The hurrier I go, the behinder I get.”</p>
          </div>
          <p>Lewis Carroll, orig. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, (born Jan. 27, 1832, Daresbury, Cheshire, Eng.—died Jan. 14, 1898, Guildford, Surrey), British logician, mathematician, and novelist. An unmarried deacon and a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Oxford, he enjoyed the company of young girls. His novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865; illustrated by John Tenniel) is based on stories he told to amuse young friends, especially Alice Liddell. Its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass (1871), describes Alice’s further adventures. The two books, full of whimsy but also of sophisticated wit and puzzles, became among the most famous and admired children’s books in the world. Carroll’s other works include the narrative nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark (1876) and the children’s novels Sylvie and Bruno (1889) and Sylvie and Bruno Concluded (1893). He was also an important early portrait photographer.</p>
          <p>A Famous Quote from His Book “If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't. And contrary wise, what is, it wouldn't be. And what it wouldn't be, it would.”</p>
